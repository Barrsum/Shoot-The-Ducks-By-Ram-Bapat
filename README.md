## Overview

This project reimagines the retro fun of Duck Hunt for the modern web. It features a sleek dark interface where players use their mouse or touch input to shoot ducks flying across the screen. Ducks emerge from the bottom, bounce off walls, and attempt to escape at the top. Shooting ducks increases the score, while letting them escape reduces lives. The game progressively increases difficulty by speeding up ducks and spawning more of them as the score climbs.

The goal was to create a visually appealing and engaging web game experience using React, modern CSS, and exploring AI-assisted development ("Vibe Coding").
